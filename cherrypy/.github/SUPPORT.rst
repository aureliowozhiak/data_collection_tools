Support
=======

You've read the documentation and you've brushed up on the basics of
Python and web development, but you still could use some help. Users
have several options.

I have a question
-----------------

If you have a question and cannot find an answer for it in issues or the
the `documentation <http://docs.cherrypy.dev/en/latest/>`__, `please
create an issue <https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/issues/new>`__.

Questions and their answers have great value for the community, and a
tip is to really put the effort in and write a good explanation, you
will get better and quicker answers. Examples are strongly encouraged.

I have found a bug
------------------

If no one have already, `create an
issue <https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/issues/new>`__. Be sure to
provide ample information, remember that any help won't be better than
your explanation.

Unless something is very obviously wrong, you are likely to be asked to
provide a working example, displaying the erroneous behaviour.

Note: While this might feel troublesome, a tip is to always make a
separate example that have the same dependencies as your project. It is
great for troubleshooting those annoying problems where you don't know
if the problem is at your end or the components. Also, you can then
easily fork and provide as an example. You will get answers and
resolutions way quicker. Also, many other open source projects require
it.

I have a feature request
------------------------

`Good stuff! Please create an
issue! <https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/issues/new>`__\  Note:
Features are more likely to be added the more users they seem to
benefit.

I want to converse
------------------

`The gitter page <https://gitter.im/cherrypy/cherrypy>`__ is good for
when you want to discuss in real time or get pointed in the right
direction.
