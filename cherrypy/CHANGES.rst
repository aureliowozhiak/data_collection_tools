v18.8.0
-------

* :issue:`1974`: Dangerous characters received in a host header
  encoded using RFC 2047 are now elided by default. Currently,
  dangerous characters are defined as CR and LF. The original
  value is still available as ``cherrypy.request.headers['Host'].raw``
  if needed.

v18.7.0
-------

* :pr:`1923`: Drop support for Python 3.5.
* :pr:`1945`: Fixed compatibility on Python 3.11.

v18.6.1
-------

* :issue:`1849` via :pr:`1879`: Fixed XLF flag in gzip header
  emitted by gzip compression tool per
  :rfc:`1952#section-2.3.1` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

* :issue:`1874`: Restricted depending on pywin32 only under
  CPython so that it won't get pulled-in under PyPy
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

* :issue:`1920`: Bumped minimum version of PyWin32 to 227.
  Block pywin32 install on Python 3.10 and later.

v18.6.0
-------

* :issue:`1776` via :pr:`1851`: Add support for UTF-8 encoded attachment
  file names in ``Content-Disposition`` header via :rfc:`6266#appendix-D`.

v18.5.0
-------

* :issue:`1827`: Fixed issue where bytes values in a ``HeaderMap``
  would be converted to strings.

* :pr:`1826`: Rely on
  `jaraco.collections <https://pypi.org/project/jaraco.collections>`_
  for its case-insensitive dictionary support.

v18.4.0
-------

* :pr:`1715`: Fixed issue in cpstats where the ``data/`` endpoint
  would fail with encoding errors on Python 3.

* :pr:`1821`: Simplify the passthrough of parameters to
  ``CPWebCase.getPage`` to cheroot. CherryPy now requires
  cheroot 8.2.1 or later.

v18.3.0
-------

* :pr:`1806`: Support handling multiple exceptions when processing hooks as
  reported in :issue:`1770`.

v18.2.0
-------

* File-based sessions no longer attempt to remove the lock files
  when releasing locks, instead deferring to the default behavior
  of zc.lockfile. Fixes :issue:`1391` and :issue:`1779`.

* :pr:`1794`: Add native support for ``308 Permanent Redirect``
  usable via ``raise cherrypy.HTTPRedirect('/new_uri', 308)``.

v18.1.2
-------

* Fixed :issue:`1377` via :pr:`1785`: Restore a native WSGI-less
  HTTP server support.
* :pr:`1769`: Reduce log level for non-error events in win32.py

v18.1.1
-------

* :pr:`1774` reverts :pr:`1759` as new evidence emerged that
  the original behavior was intentional. Re-opens :issue:`1758`.

v18.1.0
-------

* :issue:`1758` via :pr:`1759`: In the bus, when awaiting a
  state change, only publish after the state has changed.

v18.0.1
-------

* :issue:`1738` via :pr:`1736`: Restore support for 'bytes'
  in response headers.

* Substantial removal of Python 2 compatibility code.

v18.0.0

* :issue:`1730`: Drop support for Python 2.7. CherryPy 17 will
  remain an LTS release for bug and security fixes.

* Drop support for Python 3.4.

v17.4.2
-------

* Fixed :issue:`1377` by backporting :pr:`1785` via :pr:`1786`:
  Restore a native WSGI-less HTTP server support.

v17.4.1
-------

* :issue:`1738` via :pr:`1755`: Restore support for 'bytes'
  in response headers (backport from v18.0.1).

v17.4.0
-------

* :commit:`a95e619f`: When setting Response Body, reject Unicode
  values, making behavior on Python 2 same as on Python 3.

* Other inconsequential refactorings.

v17.3.0
-------

* :issue:`1193` via :pr:`1729`: Rely on zc.lockfile for
  session concurrency support.

v17.2.0
-------

* :issue:`1690` via :pr:`1692`: Prevent orphaned Event object in cached
  304 response.

v17.1.0
-------

* :issue:`1694` via :pr:`1695`: Add support for accepting uploaded files
  with non-ascii filenames per RFC 5987.

v17.0.0
-------

* :issue:`1673`: CherryPy now allows namespace packages for
  its dependencies. Environments that cannot handle namespace
  packgaes like py2exe will need to add such support or pin to
  older CherryPy versions.

v16.0.3
-------

* :issue:`1722`: Pinned the ``tempora`` dependency against
  version 1.13 to avoid pulling in namespace packages.

v16.0.2
-------

* :issue:`1716` via :pr:`1717`: Fixed handling of url-encoded parameters
  in digest authentication handling, correcting regression in v14.2.0.

* :issue:`1719` via :commit:`1d41828`: Digest-auth tool will now return
  a status code of 401 for when a scheme other than 'digest' is
  indicated.

v16.0.0
-------

* :issue:`1688` via :commit:`38ad1da`: Removed  ``basic_auth`` and
  ``digest_auth`` tools and the ``httpauth`` module, which have been
  officially deprecated earlier in v14.0.0.

* Removed deprecated properties:

  - ``cherrypy._cpreqbody.Entity.type`` deprecated in favor of
    :py:attr:`cherrypy._cpreqbody.Entity.content_type`

  - ``cherrypy._cprequest.Request.body_params`` deprecated in favor of
    :py:attr:`cherrypy._cprequest.RequestBody.params`

* :issue:`1377`: In _cp_native server, set ``req.status`` using bytes
  (fixed in :pr:`1712`).

* :issue:`1697` via :commit:`841f795`: Fixed error on Python 3.7 with
  AutoReloader when ``__file__`` is ``None``.

* :issue:`1713` via :commit:`15aa80d`: Fix warning emitted during
  test run.

* :issue:`1370` via :commit:`38f199c`: Fail with HTTP 400 for invalid
  headers.

v15.0.0
-------

* :issue:`1708`: Removed components from webtest that were
  removed in the refactoring of cheroot.test.webtest for
  cheroot 6.1.0.

v14.2.0
-------

* :issue:`1680` via :pr:`1683`: Basic Auth and Digest Auth
  tools now support :rfc:`7617` UTF-8 charset decoding where
  possible, using latin-1 as a fallback.

v14.1.0
-------

* :cr-pr:`37`: Add support for peercreds lookup over UNIX domain socket.
  This enables app to automatically identify "who's on the other
  end of the wire".

  This is how you enable it::

    server.peercreds: True
    server.peercreds_resolve: True

  The first option will put remote numeric data to WSGI env vars:
  app's PID, user's id and group.

  Second option will resolve that into user and group names.

  To prevent expensive syscalls, data is cached on per connection
  basis.

v14.0.1
-------

* :issue:`1700`: Improve windows pywin32 dependency declaration via
  conditional extras.

v14.0.0
-------

* :issue:`1688`: Officially deprecated ``basic_auth`` and ``digest_auth``
  tools and the ``httpauth`` module, triggering DeprecationWarnings
  if they're used. Applications should instead adapt to use the
  more recent ``auth_basic`` and ``auth_digest`` tools.
  This deprecated functionality will be removed in a subsequent
  release soon.
* Removed ``DeprecatedTool`` and the long-deprecated and disabled
  ``tidy`` and ``nsgmls`` tools. See `the rationale
  <https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/pull/1689#issuecomment-362924962>`_
  for this change.

v13.1.0
-------

* :issue:`1231` via :pr:`1654`: CaseInsensitiveDict now re-uses the
  generalized functionality from ``jaraco.collections`` to
  provide a more complete interface for a CaseInsensitiveDict
  and HeaderMap.

  Users are encouraged to use the implementation from
  `jaraco.collections <https://pypi.org/project/jaraco.collections>`_
  except when dealing with headers in CherryPy.

v13.0.1
-------

* :pr:`1671`: Restore support for installing CherryPy into
  environments hostile to namespace packages, broken since
  the 11.1.0 release.

v13.0.0
-------

* :issue:`1666`: Drop support for Python 3.3.

v12.0.2
-------

* :issue:`1665`: In request processing, when an invalid cookie is
  received, render the actual error message reported rather
  than guessing (sometimes incorrectly) what error occurred.

v12.0.1
-------

* Fixed issues importing :py:mod:`cherrypy.test.webtest` (by creating
  a module and importing classes from :py:mod:`cheroot`) and added a
  corresponding :py:class:`DeprecationWarning`.

v12.0.0
-------

* Drop support for Python 3.1 and 3.2.

* :issue:`1625`: Removed response timeout and timeout monitor and
  related exceptions, as it not possible to interrupt a request.
  Servers that wish to exit a request prematurely are
  recommended to monitor ``response.time`` and raise an
  exception or otherwise act accordingly.

  Servers that previously disabled timeouts by invoking
  ``cherrypy.engine.timeout_monitor.unsubscribe()`` will now
  crash. For forward-compatibility with this release on older
  versions of CherryPy, disable
  timeouts using the config option::

    'engine.timeout_monitor.on': False,

  Or test for the presence of the timeout_monitor attribute::

    with contextlib2.suppress(AttributeError):
        cherrypy.engine.timeout_monitor.unsubscribe()

  Additionally, the ``TimeoutError`` exception has been removed,
  as it's no longer called anywhere. If your application
  benefits from this Exception, please comment in the linked
  ticket describing the use case, and we'll help devise a
  solution or bring the exception back.

v11.3.0
-------

* Bump to cheroot 5.9.0.

* ``cherrypy.test.webtest`` module is now merged with the
  ``cheroot.test.webtest`` module. The CherryPy name is retained
  for now for compatibility and will be removed eventually.

v11.2.0
-------

* ``cherrypy.engine.subscribe`` now may be called without a
  callback, in which case it returns a decorator expecting the
  callback.

* :pr:`1656`: Images are now compressed using lossless compression
  and consume less space.

v11.1.0
-------

* :pr:`1611`: Expose default status logic for a redirect as
  ``HTTPRedirect.default_status``.

* :pr:`1615`: ``HTTPRedirect.status`` is now an instance property and
  derived from the value in ``args``. Although it was previously
  possible to set the property on an instance, and this change
  prevents that possibilty, CherryPy never relied on that behavior
  and we presume no applications depend on that interface.

* :issue:`1627`: Fixed issue in proxy tool where more than one port would
  appear in the ``request.base`` and thus in ``cherrypy.url``.

* :pr:`1645`: Added new log format markers:

  - ``i`` holds a per-request UUID4
  - ``z`` outputs UTC time in format of RFC 3339
  - ``cherrypy._cprequest.Request.unique_id.uuid4`` now has lazily
    invocable UUID4

* :issue:`1646`: Improve http status conversion helper.

* :pr:`1638`: Always use backslash for path separator when processing
  paths in staticdir.

* :issue:`1190`: Fix gzip, caching, and staticdir tools integration. Makes
  cache of gzipped content valid.

* Requires cheroot 5.8.3 or later.

* Also, many improvements around continuous integration and code
  quality checks.

This release contained an unintentional regression in environments that
are hostile to namespace packages, such as Pex, Celery, and py2exe.
See :pr:`1671` for details.

v11.0.0
-------

* :issue:`1607`: Dropped support for Python 2.6.

v10.2.2
-------

* :issue:`1595`: Fixed over-eager normalization of paths in cherrypy.url.

v10.2.1
-------

* Remove unintended dependency on ``graphviz`` in Python
  2.6.

v10.2.0
-------

* :pr:`1580`: ``CPWSGIServer.version`` now reported as
  ``CherryPy/x.y.z Cheroot/x.y.z``. Bump to cheroot 5.2.0.
* The codebase is now :pep:`8` complaint, flake8 linter is `enabled in TravisCI by
  default <https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/commit/b6e752b>`_.
* Max line restriction is now set to 120 for flake8 linter.
* :pep:`257` linter runs as separate allowed failure job in Travis CI.
* A few bugs related to undeclared variables have been fixed.
* ``pre-commit`` testing goes faster due to enabled caching.

v10.1.1
-------

* :issue:`1342`: Fix AssertionError on shutdown.

v10.1.0
-------

* Bump to cheroot 5.1.0.

* :issue:`794`: Prefer setting max-age for session cookie
  expiration, moving MSIE hack into a function
  documenting its purpose.

v10.0.0
-------

* :issue:`1332`: CherryPy now uses `portend
  <https://pypi.org/project/portend>`_ for checking and
  waiting on ports for startup and teardown checks. The
  following names are no longer present:

  - cherrypy._cpserver.client_host
  - cherrypy._cpserver.check_port
  - cherrypy._cpserver.wait_for_free_port
  - cherrypy._cpserver.wait_for_occupied_port
  - cherrypy.process.servers.check_port
  - cherrypy.process.servers.wait_for_free_port
  - cherrypy.process.servers.wait_for_occupied_port

  Use this functionality from the portend package directly.

v9.0.0
------

* :issue:`1481`: Move functionality from cherrypy.wsgiserver to
  the `cheroot 5.0 <https://pypi.org/project/Cheroot/5.0.1/>`_
  project.

v8.9.1
------

* :issue:`1537`: Restore dependency on pywin32 for Python 3.6.

v8.9.0
------

* :pr:`1547`: Replaced ``cherryd`` distutils script with a setuptools
  console entry point.

  When running CherryPy in daemon mode, the forked process no
  longer changes directory to ``/``. If that behavior is something
  on which your application relied and should rely, please file
  a ticket with the project.

v8.8.0
------

* :pr:`1528`: Allow a timeout of 0 to server.

v8.7.0
------

* :issue:`645`: Setting a bind port of 0 will bind to an ephemeral port.

v8.6.0
------

* :issue:`1538` and :issue:`1090`: Removed cruft from the setup script and
  instead rely on `include_package_data
  <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html?highlight=include_package_data#new-and-changed-setup-keywords>`_
  to ensure the relevant files are included in the package.
  Note, this change does cause LICENSE.md no longer to
  be included in the installed package.

v8.5.0
------

* The pyOpenSSL support is now included on Python 3 builds,
  removing the last disparity between Python 2 and Python 3
  in the CherryPy package. This change is one small step
  in consideration of :issue:`1399`. This change also fixes RPM
  builds, as reported in :issue:`1149`.

v8.4.0
------

* :issue:`1532`: Also release wheels for Python 2, enabling
  offline installation.

v8.3.1
------

* :issue:`1537`: Disable dependency on pypiwin32 on Python 3.6
  until a viable build of pypiwin32 can be made on that
  Python version.

v8.3.0
------

* Consolidated some documentation and include the more
  concise readme in the package long description, as found
  on PyPI.

v8.2.0
------

* :issue:`1463`: CherryPy tests are now run under pytest and
  invoked using tox.

v8.1.3
------

* :issue:`1530`: Fix the issue with TypeError being swallowed by
  decorated handlers.

v8.1.2
------

* :issue:`1508`

v8.1.1
------

* :issue:`1497`: Handle errors thrown by ``ssl_module: 'builtin'``
  when client opens connection to HTTPS port using HTTP.

* :issue:`1350`: Fix regression introduced in v6.1.0 where environment
  construction for WSGIGateway_u0 was passing one parameter
  and not two.

* Other miscellaneous fixes.

v8.1.0
------

* :issue:`1473`: ``HTTPError`` now also works as a context manager.

* :issue:`1487`: The sessions tool now accepts a ``storage_class``
  parameter, which supersedes the new deprecated
  ``storage_type`` parameter. The ``storage_class`` should
  be the actual Session subclass to be used.

* Releases now use ``setuptools_scm`` to track the release
  versions. Therefore, releases can be cut by simply tagging
  a commit in the repo. Versions numbers are now stored in
  exactly one place.

v8.0.1
------

* :issue:`1489` via :pr:`1493`: Additionally reject anything else that's
  not bytes.
* :issue:`1492`: systemd socket activation.

v8.0.0
------

* :issue:`1483`: Remove Deprecated constructs:

  - ``cherrypy.lib.http`` module.
  - ``unrepr``, ``modules``, and ``attributes`` in
    ``cherrypy.lib``.

* :pr:`1476`: Drop support for python-memcached<1.58
* :issue:`1401`: Handle NoSSLErrors.
* :issue:`1489`: In ``wsgiserver.WSGIGateway.respond``, the application
  must now yield bytes and not text, as the spec requires.
  If text is received, it will now raise a ValueError instead
  of silently encoding using ISO-8859-1.
* Removed unicode filename from the package, working around
  :gh:`pypa/pip#3894 <pypa/pip/issues/3894>` and :gh:`pypa/setuptools#704
  <pypa/setuptools/issues/704>`.

v7.1.0
------

* :pr:`1458`: Implement systemd's socket activation mechanism for
  CherryPy servers, based on work sponsored by Endless Computers.

  Socket Activation allows one to setup a system so that
  systemd will sit on a port and start services
  'on demand' (a little bit like inetd and xinetd
  used to do).

v7.0.0
------

Removed the long-deprecated backward compatibility for
legacy config keys in the engine. Use the config for the
namespaced-plugins instead:

 - autoreload_on -> autoreload.on
 - autoreload_frequency -> autoreload.frequency
 - autoreload_match -> autoreload.match
 - reload_files -> autoreload.files
 - deadlock_poll_frequency -> timeout_monitor.frequency

v6.2.1
------

* :issue:`1460`: Fix KeyError in Bus.publish when signal handlers
  set in config.

v6.2.0
------

* :issue:`1441`: Added tool to automatically convert request
  params based on type annotations (primarily in
  Python 3). For example::

    @cherrypy.tools.params()
    def resource(self, limit: int):
        assert isinstance(limit, int)

v6.1.1
------

* Issue :issue:`1411`: Fix issue where autoreload fails when
  the host interpreter for CherryPy was launched using
  ``python -m``.

v6.1.0
------

* Combined wsgiserver2 and wsgiserver3 modules into a
  single module, ``cherrypy.wsgiserver``.

v6.0.2
------

* Issue :pr:`1445`: Correct additional typos.

v6.0.1
------

* Issue :issue:`1444`: Correct typos in ``@cherrypy.expose``
  decorators.

v6.0.0
------

* Setuptools is now required to build CherryPy. Pure
  distutils installs are no longer supported. This change
  allows CherryPy to depend on other packages and re-use
  code from them. It's still possible to install
  pre-built CherryPy packages (wheels) using pip without
  Setuptools.
* `six <https://pypi.io/project/six>`_ is now a
  requirement and subsequent requirements will be
  declared in the project metadata.
* :issue:`1440`: Back out changes from :pr:`1432` attempting to
  fix redirects with Unicode URLs, as it also had the
  unintended consequence of causing the 'Location'
  to be ``bytes`` on Python 3.
* ``cherrypy.expose`` now works on classes.
* ``cherrypy.config`` decorator is now used throughout
  the code internally.

v5.6.0
------

* ``@cherrypy.expose`` now will also set the exposed
  attribute on a class.
* Rewrote all tutorials and internal usage to prefer
  the decorator usage of ``expose`` rather than setting
  the attribute explicitly.
* Removed test-specific code from tutorials.

v5.5.0
------

* :issue:`1397`: Fix for filenames with semicolons and quote
  characters in filenames found in headers.
* :issue:`1311`: Added decorator for registering tools.
* :issue:`1194`: Use simpler encoding rules for SCRIPT_NAME
  and PATH_INFO environment variables in CherryPy Tree
  allowing non-latin characters to pass even when
  ``wsgi.version`` is not ``u.0``.
* :issue:`1352`: Ensure that multipart fields are decoded even
  when cached in a file.

v5.4.0
------

* ``cherrypy.test.webtest.WebCase`` now honors a
  'WEBTEST_INTERACTIVE' environment variable to disable
  interactive tests (still enabled by default). Set to '0'
  or 'false' or 'False' to disable interactive tests.
* :issue:`1408`: Fix AttributeError when listiterator was accessed
  using the ``next`` attribute.
* :issue:`748`: Removed ``cherrypy.lib.sessions.PostgresqlSession``.
* :pr:`1432`: Fix errors with redirects to Unicode URLs.

v5.3.0
------

* :issue:`1202`: Add support for specifying a certificate authority when
  serving SSL using the built-in SSL support.
* Use ssl.create_default_context when available.
* :issue:`1392`: Catch platform-specific socket errors on OS X.
* :issue:`1386`: Fix parsing of URIs containing ``://`` in the path part.

v5.2.0
------

* :issue:`1410`: Moved hosting to Github
  (`cherrypy/cherrypy <https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy>`_).

v5.1.0
------

* Bugfix issue :issue:`1315` for ``test_HTTP11_pipelining`` test in Python 3.5
* Bugfix issue :issue:`1382` regarding the keyword arguments support for Python 3
  on the config file.
* Bugfix issue :issue:`1406` for ``test_2_KeyboardInterrupt`` test in Python 3.5.
  by monkey patching the HTTPRequest given a bug on CPython
  that is affecting the testsuite (https://bugs.python.org/issue23377).
* Add additional parameter ``raise_subcls`` to the tests helpers
  `openURL` and ``CPWebCase.getPage`` to have finer control on
  which exceptions can be raised.
* Add support for direct keywords on the calls (e.g. ``foo=bar``) on
  the config file under Python 3.
* Add additional validation to determine if the process is running
  as a daemon on ``cherrypy.process.plugins.SignalHandler`` to allow
  the execution of the testsuite under CI tools.

v5.0.1
------

* Bugfix for NameError following :issue:`94`.

v5.0.0
------

* Removed deprecated support for ``ssl_certificate`` and
  ``ssl_private_key`` attributes and implicit construction
  of SSL adapter on Python 2 WSGI servers.
* Default SSL Adapter on Python 2 is the builtin SSL adapter,
  matching Python 3 behavior.
* Pull request :issue:`94`: In proxy tool, defer to Host header for
  resolving the base if no base is supplied.

v4.0.0
------

* Drop support for Python 2.5 and earlier.
* No longer build Windows installers by default.

v3.8.2
------

* Pull Request :issue:`116`: Correct InternalServerError when null bytes in
  static file path. Now responds with 404 instead.

v3.8.0
------

* Pull Request :issue:`96`: Pass ``exc_info`` to logger as keyword rather than
  formatting the error and injecting into the message.

v3.7.0
------

* CherryPy daemon may now be invoked with ``python -m cherrypy`` in
  addition to the ``cherryd`` script.
* Issue :issue:`1298`: Fix SSL handling on CPython 2.7 with builtin SSL module
  and pyOpenSSL 0.14. This change will break PyPy for now.
* Several documentation fixes.

v3.6.0
------

* Fixed HTTP range headers for negative length larger than content size.
* Disabled universal wheel generation as wsgiserver has Python duality.
* Pull Request :issue:`42`: Correct TypeError in ``check_auth`` when encrypt is used.
* Pull Request :issue:`59`: Correct signature of HandlerWrapperTool.
* Pull Request :issue:`60`: Fix error in SessionAuth where login_screen was
  incorrectly used.
* Issue :issue:`1077`: Support keyword-only arguments in dispatchers (Python 3).
* Issue :issue:`1019`: Allow logging host name in the access log.
* Pull Request :issue:`50`: Fixed race condition in session cleanup.

v3.5.0
------

* Issue :issue:`1301`: When the incoming queue is full, now reject additional
  connections. This functionality was added to CherryPy 3.0, but
  unintentionally lost in 3.1.

v3.4.0
------

* Miscellaneous quality improvements.

v3.3.0
------

CherryPy adopts semver.
